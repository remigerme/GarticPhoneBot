# GarticPhoneBot

A bot which draws picture for you in GarticPhone.

It currently is not convenient to use but it is working on Windows & Linux.

TODO : code light features (be able to select a box where to draw the picture, a more convenient user interface), get the bot to click on macos, and refactor / clean the whole code.
