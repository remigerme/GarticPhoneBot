# GarticPhoneBot

A bot which draws picture for you in GarticPhone.

It currently is not convenient to use but it is working on Windows & Linux.

I recorded [a demo of the bot](https://youtu.be/bwtxdRxMUgc) drawing a pretty high-res picture of yoshi ; I still struggle with drawing such big pictures (ie large pictures with scale drawing close to 1) as it takes a long time.

**TODO :** code light features (be able to select a box where to draw the picture, a more convenient user interface), get the bot to click on macos, and refactor / clean the whole code.
